## Issue #1: Vercel 404 NOT_FOUND Error

### Problem Description
- **Symptoms**: Website deployed successfully to Vercel but returned 404 NOT_FOUND error
- **Status**: Vercel dashboard showed "Ready" status ✅
- **Build**: All build processes completed without errors ✅
- **Local**: Development server worked perfectly ✅
- **Production**: Live URLs returned 404 errors ❌

### Environment Details
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.4 with App Router
- **React Version**: 19.1.0
- **TypeScript**: Yes
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel
- **Domain**: marsfront.com

### Diagnostic Process

1. **Build Output Verification**
   ```bash
   ls -la .next/server/app/
   # Confirmed files exist: index.html, page.js, page.js.nft.json
   ```

2. **Route Configuration Check**
   ```bash
   cat .next/prerender-manifest.json
   cat .next/routes-manifest.json
   # Confirmed "/" route properly configured
   ```

3. **Deployment Logs Analysis**
   ```bash
   npx vercel inspect [deployment-url] --logs
   # No build errors, successful compilation
   ```

4. **HTTP Response Analysis**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://marsfront.com
   # HTTP/2 404, server: Vercel, x-vercel-error: NOT_FOUND
   ```

### Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issue**: Vercel failed to correctly identify the project as a Next.js application, leading to improper routing configuration despite successful builds.

**Contributing Factors**:
- Missing explicit Vercel configuration
- Complex component structure (initially used separate home-page.tsx)
- Reliance on Vercel's automatic framework detection

### Solution Implemented

**Step 1: Add Explicit Vercel Configuration**
Created `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

**Step 2: Consolidate Component Structure**
- Moved all homepage content from `app/components/home-page.tsx` to `app/page.tsx`
- Eliminated component import issues
- Simplified build process

**Step 3: Clean Deployment**
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add explicit Vercel configuration"
git push
npx vercel --prod --yes
npx vercel alias [new-deployment] marsfront.com
```

### Resolution Verification
```bash
curl -s https://marsfront.com | head -5
# ✅ Returns full HTML content with title "MARSFRONT | Masters of Digital Intelligence"
```

### Timeline
- **Issue Discovery**: 02:25 UTC - 404 errors on production
- **Diagnosis Phase**: 02:25 - 02:34 UTC - Root cause identification
- **Solution Implementation**: 02:34 - 02:36 UTC - vercel.json creation and deployment
- **Resolution Confirmed**: 02:36 UTC - Website fully operational

## Issue #2: Component Import Resolution (Resolved)

### Problem
Initial deployment attempts failed due to component structure where `app/page.tsx` imported from `./components/home-page` but Vercel couldn't resolve the import properly.

### Solution
Consolidated all component code into single `app/page.tsx` file, eliminating import dependencies.

---

## Issue #3: Deployment Protection (Resolved)

### Problem
Earlier deployments returned HTTP 401 due to Vercel's deployment protection feature being enabled.

### Solution
Disabled deployment protection in Vercel dashboard settings.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Explicit Configuration > Auto-Detection**
   - Always provide `vercel.json` for complex Next.js projects
   - Don't rely solely on Vercel's framework auto-detection

2. **Component Architecture Considerations**
   - Keep critical components in main pages for deployment reliability
   - Complex component imports can cause deployment issues

3. **Diagnostic Approach**
   - Check build outputs locally before investigating server issues
   - Verify route manifests match expected configuration
   - Use curl for direct HTTP response analysis

4. **Testing Methodology**
   - Test both direct deployment URLs and custom domains
   - Verify complete HTML content, not just HTTP status codes

---

## Preventive Measures

1. **Always include `vercel.json` for Next.js projects**
2. **Test deployments with simple component structures first**
3. **Monitor Vercel dashboard for deployment protection settings**
4. **Maintain local build parity with production**

## Final Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: Website fully operational at https://marsfront.com
✅ **Performance**: 154KB homepage, static optimization enabled
✅ **Features**: All Mars-themed visuals and animations working
